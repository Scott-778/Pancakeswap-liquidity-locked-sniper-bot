Turn on Two step verification in telegram. Go to my.telegram.org and create App to get api_id and api_hash. You need to install nodejs from nodejs.org, the lastest LTS Version. Use at your own risk. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky not financial advice. If you can code and want to make this project better please feel free to contribute. There is a small 0.7% buying fee per buy. This is to help me buy a cup of coffee and support for this project.

Join my telegram group where we can talk about this project, tokens and the best strategies. https://t.me/CoinMarketCapSniperBot
